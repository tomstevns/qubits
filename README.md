# AI-Driven Discovery of Physics-Native Quantum Information Units

This repository contains the accompanying material for the whitepaper:

**AI-Driven Discovery of Physics-Native Quantum Information Units**  
Version 1.0 — December 2025  
Author: Tom Stevns

The work explores whether quantum information units (beyond engineered qubits)  
may naturally emerge from the symmetry, degeneracy, and low-energy structure  
of physical Hamiltonians — and whether modern AI systems can help identify  
such subspaces.

Recent progress in error-correction codes and decoding algorithms suggests  
that large physical-to-logical qubit overheads may be a sign not of physics  
limitations, but of a mismatch between human-designed abstractions and  
the information structures the underlying physics naturally prefers.

This project aims to investigate that question in a systematic, modular way.

## Overview

The whitepaper proposes an AI-assisted pipeline with five major components:

1. **Hamiltonian Library**  
   A curated set of model Hamiltonians (both synthetic and physically motivated)  
   providing the search space for potential information-preserving structures.

2. **AI Discovery Engine**  
   Neural architectures trained to identify stable subspaces, symmetries,  
   conserved quantities, and low-noise regions in the Hilbert space.

3. **Dynamics Simulator**  
   Time-evolution and decoherence simulations used to test candidate subspaces  
   under realistic noise models.

4. **Stability Scoring**  
   Quantitative evaluation of how well a candidate subspace preserves  
   information relative to engineered qubits.

5. **Realization Filter**  
   A mapping layer that checks which candidates could be realized in  
   contemporary physical platforms (ion traps, superconducting devices,  
   photonic systems, cold atoms, etc.).

The goal is not to define a single “new qubit”, but to explore the broader  
space of physics-native information encodings that may reduce overhead and  
align more closely with the structure of nature itself.

## Status

This is an exploratory research project.  
The intention is to contribute quietly and constructively to ongoing  
discussions about quantum information encoding, error correction,  
and the relationship between physical symmetries and computation.

Future updates may include:

- example Hamiltonians  
- initial discovery engine prototypes  
- visual diagrams of the pipeline  
- simulation notebooks  
- and expanded discussion sections in the whitepaper
